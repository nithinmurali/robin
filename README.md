## Robin

A platform-game based on SDL 2.0 library. This was my first year project, so a BIG mess.
It has a level editor and the game.

# Make it work

You will mostly need to install ![sdl 2.0](https://wiki.libsdl.org/Installation)

If you are in ubuntu, this would do
`
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-2.0
`

Use the level editor (level editor/src/a.out) to create levels. scroll to change tiles and click to place them.
Then place the generated robon.map file into the _levels_ folder in the formal robon<level_number>.map
run the game using (src/ROBON.out)
